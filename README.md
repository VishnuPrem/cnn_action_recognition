# Dual stream CNN for Action Recognition

Inspired by the journal paper article titled 'Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos'. You can view it [**here**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199.pdf)


This project is to implement an action detection binary classifier to detect violence by extracting spatial and temporal data. The classifier finds applications in public surveillance and social media screening. The feature extraction method and model architecture implemented can be extended to any kind of action recognition from videos.
