# Violence detection from Videos using Dual stream CNN

Inspired by the journal paper article titled 'Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos'. You can view it [**here**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199.pdf)


This project is to implement an action detection binary classifier to detect violence by extracting spatial and temporal data. The classifier finds applications in public surveillance and social media screening. The feature extraction method and model architecture implemented can be extended to any kind of action recognition from videos.

The [**dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset
) we used consists of 1000 short clips from each class: Violence and Nonviolence. Each video ranges from a duration of 1 to 6 seconds.
The videos from the violence class includes violent interactions between people in different setting like street fights and physical altercations during sports games. The non violence class has videos of people in group taking part in various activities that are non violent.
